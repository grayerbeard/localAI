Best and Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”). A.M. Best has upgraded the FSR to A+ (Superior) from A (Excellent) and the Long-Term ICR to “aa-” from “a+” of the Property/Casualty subsidiaries of XL Group Ltd (“XL”) as well as those of AXA Insurance Company with a stable outlook.

We use Gateway Capital Limited hereinafter after referred to as the Premium Finance Provider (PFP) who, subject to acceptance and criteria, will provide funding to you. We may also be able to offer finance for your insurance premium through your insurer, details of which have been included below if available. In arranging premium finance there are a number of benefits, including: - Not having to pay the full amount upfront; - The ability to support budgeting by spreading the cost; - Having a single credit agreement and direct debit for a number of policies which can reduce paperwork and thereby saving you time. Please be aware that using premium finance will be more expensive compared to paying for your policy in full at the start of your policy, as outlined in the table below: |Col1|Premium Finance|Single Payment| |---|---|---| |Total amount funded|£344.38|£344.38| |Service charge|6.5%|| |Representative APR (variable)|14.87%|| |Total charge for credit *|£22.39|| |Typical monthly payment of|£36.68|| |Total number of monthly instalments **|10|| |Final payment of|£36.64|| |Total amount payable|£366.76|£344.38| - If you choose to pay for your premium(s) by applying for premium finance and entering into a credit agreement with the above PFP, this is the how much more it will cost rather than paying your premium as a single amount at the start of your policy. ** This is the duration of your credit agreement; however, your policy is for a 12 month duration. Important information in relation to your premium finance quotation The following information should be read in conjunction with the “Terms of Payment” section of our Terms of Business Agreement (TOBA) with you. We are providing you with information about this payment option on a non-advised basis from which you will need to make your own decision as to the suitability of this facility and whether you wish to proceed. Please consider the financial commitment you are making when entering into an application for credit. Please note that your policy cover will cease if you fail to keep up payments on any instalment agreement in relation to your insurance premium. In arranging premium finance, we will use the personal data provided by you. Details on how we will use your data are detailed in our TOBA which also includes a link to our Privacy Notice, or you can request a copy by contacting us. In assessing your application your data will be shared with the PFP who may use credit scoring, credit reference agencies and automated decision-making systems to carry out anti-money laundering checks and credit assessments. This type of search does leave a footprint on your credit report but should not have a detrimental effect on your credit rating. ----- Should your application for premium finance be unsuccessful, the PFP will notify you in writing and you will need to find an alternative way to pay for your insurance premiums. Please note that by entering into a credit agreement with the PFP, you are assigning all your rights, title and interests in and to your insurance policy. This means that should you fail to keep up the monthly repayments, your PFP has the right to instruct cancellation of your insurance policy and offset any refunds due or claims payments outstanding against the balance remaining on your credit agreement. Cancellation rights*: Where this is a new agreement, you can withdraw free of charge from the credit agreement without penalty, within 14 days of signing your credit agreement. After this time, additional fees will be incurred. If you do withdraw, you will have to pay back any credit you received and find an alternative method of paying your insurance premium. *This right only applies to private individuals and sole traders as well as small partnership (consisting of two or three persons) and unincorporated bodies (such as trust, members’ clubs, voluntary organisations, charitable organisations and religious communities) where at least one member is an individual. Should you wish to pay using the PFP facility offered to you, we will instruct your PFP and unless you inform us or your PFP otherwise, your PFP will mostly communicate with you in an electronic format, using either your email address or their online portal; this will also allow you to sign your credit agreement electronically and manage your plan.

Our Service As an independent insurance intermediary, we generally act as the agent of our client, which means we would act on your behalf. We are subject to the law of agency, which imposes various duties on us. However, in certain circumstances we may act for and owe duties of care to other parties, including the insurer. We will advise you when these circumstances occur, so you will be aware of any conflicts of interest (situations which may affect our role as your agent). We offer a wide range of insurance products and services which may include: - Offering you a single or range of products from which to choose a product that suits your insurance needs; - Advising you on your insurance needs; - Arranging suitable insurance cover with insurers to meet your requirements; - Helping you with any later changes to your insurance you have to make; - Providing all reasonable help with any claim you have to make. We have access to many leading insurance companies and will advise you where we have provided advice based on a personal recommendation, which means the product is suitable for the person to whom it is made or is based on the circumstances of that person. We will also advise you when we offer you a policy on the basis of a fair and personal analysis, which means we have looked at a sufficiently large number of insurance contacts on the market to enable us to make a personal recommendation. Where we have provided advice based on a personal recommendation but not on the basis of a fair and personal analysis, we will advise you: - If we are under a contractual obligation to conduct insurance distribution exclusively with one or more insurers (which means we are tied to use these insurers) and will provide you with a list of those insurers; or - If we are not under a contractual obligation to conduct insurance distribution with one or more insurers and will provide you with a list of insurers with which we may and do place business. Before the insurance contract is concluded and after we have assessed your demands and needs, we will provide you with advice and make a personal recommendation, unless we advise otherwise. This will include sufficient information such as the main features of the product’s cover, any unusual restrictions or exclusions, any significant conditions or obligations and the period of cover to enable you to make an informed decision about the policy, together with a quotation which will itemise any fees that are payable in addition to the premium. This documentation will also include a statement of your demands and needs which you should read carefully. ### 4. Limitations of our liability The following provisions set out our entire financial liability to you. ----- employee or consultant engaged by us. Our liability for losses suffered by you arising under or in connection with the provision of our services, whether in contract, tort (a civil wrong including negligence), breach of statutory duty, or otherwise (including our liability for the acts or omissions of our senior management, employees and any appointed representatives) shall be limited to £5,000,000 per claim. Any claim or series of claims arising from one act, error, omission, incident, or original cause shall be considered to be one claim. We shall not be liable to you for any loss of profit or loss of business whether directly or indirectly occurring and which arises out of or in connection with the provision of our services. Nothing in this paragraph shall exclude or limit our liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or for loss by our fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation or breach of regulatory obligations owed to you. You are welcome to contact us to discuss increasing the limitations of our liability and or varying the exclusions set out above. ### 5. Important Information (consumers only) Under legislation, it is your duty as a consumer to take reasonable care not to make a misrepresentation to an insurer, which means you cannot provide any false information. A failure by you to comply with the insurers request to confirm or amend details previously given is capable of being a misrepresentation. It is important that you ensure all statements you make on proposal forms, claim forms and other documents are full and accurate and we recommend that you keep a copy of all correspondence in relation to the arrangement of your insurance. An insurer has the right to take corrective measures if it can deem the misrepresentation to be either deliberate, reckless, or careless. **If in doubt about any point in relation to your duty to take reasonable care and subsequent qualifying misrepresentations,** **please contact us immediately.** ### 6. The duty of fair presentation (commercial customers only) It is your responsibility to provide a fair presentation of the insurance risk based on you conducting a reasonable search for information. This could require you to obtain information from senior managers within your organisation or other parties to which the insurance relates or who carry out outsource functions for your business. You must disclose every material circumstance which you know or ought to know, or failing that, disclose sufficient information to put your insurer on notice that it needs to make further enquiries. You must ensure that any information you provide is correct to the best of your knowledge and representations that you make in expectation or belief must be made in good faith. If you fail to make a fair presentation of the risk this may result in additional terms or warranties being applied from inception of the policy or any claim payment being proportionately reduced. In some cases, this could result in your policy being declared void by an insurer and your premiums returned. Any deliberate or reckless breach of the duty of fair presentation could result in your policy being declared void by an insurer with no refund of premium. **If in doubt about any point in relation to material circumstances and reasonable search, please contact us immediately.** ### 7. Financial crime Please be aware that current UK money laundering regulations require us to obtain adequate ‘Know Your Client’ information about you. We are also required to cross check you against The Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI) HM Treasury consolidated list of Financial Sanctions Targets in the UK as part of the information gathering process. We are obliged to report to the National Crime Agency and/or Serious Fraud Office any evidence or suspicion of financial crime at the first opportunity and we are prohibited from disclosing any such report. We will not permit our employees or other persons engaged by them to be either influenced or influence others in respect of undue payments or privileges from or to insurers or clients. ### 8. Solvency of insurers We cannot guarantee the solvency of any insurer with which we place business. This means that you may still be liable for any premium due and not be able to recover the premium paid, whether in full or in part, should an insurer become unable to cover its own financial obligations. If you have any concerns regarding any insurer chosen to meet your insurance requirements, you should inform us as soon as possible. ### 9. Terms of Payment Our payment terms are as follows (unless otherwise agreed by us in writing): - New policies: immediate payment on or before the starting date of the policy. ----- If payment is not received from you in accordance with the above terms, we, or your insurer may cancel or lapse the relevant policy/policies, which could mean that part or all of a claim may not be paid. You may also be in breach of legally required insurance cover. If you choose to pay for your insurance premium using a finance provider, your details will be passed onto them. We will provide you with a breakdown of the costs of your monthly instalments and subsequently a document outlining key features of their credit agreement with you including any fees they apply and the cost of charges if you have failed to make a payment (default charges). It is important that you take time to read this document and must contact us if you do not receive this. If you have any queries or questions, either about the service provided by the finance provider or their terms and conditions you should in the first instance contact them. Where your policy is paid via the finance provider and you choose to renew your cover, we will again continue to pass your details to them. If any direct debit or other payment due in respect of any credit agreement you enter into to pay insurance premiums is not met when presented for payment or if you end the credit agreement, we will be informed of such events by the finance provider. In certain circumstances we may be contractually obliged by the finance provider to notify your insurer to cancel the policy. Where we are not contractually obliged to do so by the finance provider, if you do not make other arrangements with us to pay the insurance premiums you acknowledge and agree that we may, at any time after being informed of non-payment under the credit agreement, instruct on your behalf the relevant insurer to cancel the insurance and to collect any refund of premiums which may be made by the insurer and use this refund to offset the amount levied by the finance provider on us. If this amount is not sufficient to cover all our costs, we reserve the right to pursue any additional debt owed to us through a due legal process. You will be responsible for paying any time on risk charge and putting in place any alternative insurance and/or payment arrangements you need. Upon receiving your strict acceptance to pay for insurance premiums through the finance provider, we will instruct them to proceed with your application for credit. This process will involve the provider searching public information that a credit reference agency holds about you and any previous payment history you have with that provider. The credit reference agency will add details of your search and your application to their record about you whether or not your application is successful. Please read carefully the pre-contractual explanations and the information regarding the cost of credit (including any representative examples). Together they provide important information in relation to the credit facility available from the finance provider. Credit is available subject to status. ### 10. How we hold your money All client money is handled by us. Client money is money that we receive and hold on behalf of our clients during the course of our dealings such as premium payments, premium refunds, and claim payments. This money will be held by us either as agent of the insurer or agent of the client, determined by the agreement we have in place with each insurer. Where money is held as agent of the insurer, this means that when we have received your cleared premium, it is deemed to have been paid to the insurer. Our standard accounting practice is to take our commission upon receipt of your cleared funds prior to payment of the premium to the insurer. The FCA requires all client monies, including yours, to be held in a trust account, the purpose of which is to protect you in the event of our financial failure since, in such circumstances; our general creditors would not be able to make claims on client money as it will not form part of our assets. We hold all client monies with one or more approved banks, as defined by the FCA, in a Non-Statutory Trust bank account in accordance with the FCA client money rules. Under these arrangements, we assume responsibility for such monies and are permitted to, and may: - Use such monies received on behalf of one customer to pay another customer’s premium, before the premium is received from that other customer. - For the purpose of effecting a transaction on your behalf, pass your money to another intermediary, including those resident outside the UK who would therefore be subject to different legal and regulatory regimes. In the event of a ----- - Retain for our own use, any interest earned on client money. Unless we receive your written instruction to the contrary, we shall treat receipt of payment from you and of any claim payment and/or refund of premium which fall due to you, as being with your informed consent to the payment of those monies into the Non-Statutory Trust bank account. ### 11. Quotations Unless otherwise agreed, any quotation given will normally remain valid for a period of 30 days from the date it is provided to you. We reserve the right to withdraw or amend a quotation in certain circumstances, for example, where the insurer has altered their premium/terms for the insurance since the quotation was given, where there has been a change in the original risk information/material circumstances disclosed or if a claim/incident has occurred since the terms were offered. ### 12. Renewals You will be provided with renewal terms in good time before expiry of the policy, or notified that renewal is not being invited. Unless you advise otherwise, renewals are invited on the basis that there have been no changes in the risk or cover required, other than those specifically notified to us or your insurers (see section 5 ‘Important information’ and section 6 ‘The duty of fair presentation’). It is very important that you check the information provided at renewal to confirm it remains accurate and complete. If any of the information is incorrect or if your circumstances have changed, you should contact us immediately so we can update your details. ### 13. Mid-term transferred business When we are appointed to service insurance policies other than at their inception or renewal and which were originally arranged via another party, we shall not be liable during the current insurance period for any loss arising from any errors or omissions or gaps in your insurance cover or advice not supplied by us. Should you have any concerns in respect of a policy, which has been transferred to us, or if you require an immediate review of your insurance arrangements, you must notify us immediately. Otherwise, we shall review your insurance arrangements and advise accordingly as each policy falls due for renewal. ### 14. Notification of Incidents/Claims Your policy documentation will provide you with details on who to contact to make a claim. It is essential to notify immediately all incidents that may result in a claim against your insurance policy. You must do so whether you believe you are liable or not. Any letter or claim received by you must be passed on immediately, without acknowledgement. Only by providing prompt notification of incidents can your insurance company take steps to protect your interests. Claims payment will be made in favour of you. If you require a payment to be made to a third party, then you must confirm the required payee name and details and provide a brief explanation for your request. Please contact us for guidance on claiming under your policy. ### 15. Cancellation Your policy document will detail your rights to cancel your insurance once you have taken it out. Depending on the type of policy you have purchased, you may be entitled to cancel within 14 or 30 days of either conclusion of the contract or receiving your policy documentation, whichever occurs later. This is often referred to as a cooling off period. Where you cancel a policy before renewal, you will be responsible for paying a charge to meet the cost of cover provided and administration expenses please see section 16 ‘Remuneration, fees & charges’. To enable your insurer to process the cancellation, you will need to return certificates and any official documents to our office within 30 days of your notice to cancel. ### 16. Remuneration, fees & charges In most cases we are paid by commission from the insurer, and circumstances, we may charge you a fee instead of commission or a combination of both, in which case this will be confirmed to you in writing at the time of incepting or renewing your policy. Our fees will be confirmed to you clearly and in writing at the time of incepting or renewing your policy and will always be disclosed to you before you commit to purchasing the product. There may also be occasions when an additional fee is sought, for example changes to the ----- In addition, we also make charges as detailed below to cover the administration of your insurance. Any applicable insurance premium tax will be shown on the documentation we provide to you. These fees are non-refundable. **Customers:** Non refundable arrangement fee £35.00 Renewals £35.00 Mid Term Adjustments £35.00 Lost Papers or Duplicate Documents £35.00 Temporary Change £35.00 Return of Premium £35.00 + commission value if applicable. Cancellation £35.00 + commission value if applicable. **Commercial** A minimum as below and all are discussed and agreed prior to contract conclusion be it at inception or renewal. Transaction Value under £1000 £1001-£5000 £5001-£10000 Over £10000 Non-refundable arrangement fee £40 £100 £150 2% Renewals £40 £100 £150 2% Midterm adjustments £40 £100 £150 2% Lost Papers/Documents £40 £100 £150 2% Temporary Change £40 £100 £150 2% Cancellation/ Return of Premium fees as per above scale + full commission value if applicable. Certain Cancellations will result in a Nil Return/ Nil Refund of premium and you will be advised of these policy types prior to purchase. We may occasionally receive additional remuneration from insurers, claims management providers and others. Where you choose to pay your premium by instalments, we may use a scheme operated by your insurer, or we may use a single Finance Provider, Gateway Capital Ltd. We will advise you of any commission payable by the finance provider in relation to a credit agreement where knowledge of the existence or amount of commission could affect our impartiality in recommending a particular product or that may have a material impact on your transactional decision. You are entitled at any time to request further information regarding the amount of any remuneration which we may have received as a result of placing or renewing your insurance cover. To the extent that this is not possible for an amount to be given, we will provide the basis for its calculation. Where a policy is cancelled before renewal, insurers charge to cover their costs, with the balance refunded to you, subject to no claim having been made. Full details will be available in your policy. In the event of an adjustment giving rise to a return of premium the amount may be refunded or held to credit. **Your attention is specifically drawn to the following:** Where you cancel your policy after the expiry of the cooling off period or where you request a mid-term adjustment which results in a refund of premium, **_we reserve the right to charge you for our time and costs._** **_This will usually result in us_** **_reducing the amount refunded to you by the FULL amount of the commission and fees we would have received had you not_** **_cancelled. However, any charge made will not exceed the cost of the commission and fees we would have earned. For certain_** commercial insurance policies, insurers will only provide cover where the premium is due in full on inception of the policy. This means that no refund will be paid if the policy is cancelled before renewal. We will advise you if this affects you. Bank details may be retained for the purposes of refunds and claims payments that may be made by BACS (Bankers Automated Clearing System). ### 17.

Version 7 - July 2023 ----- When does the Insurance Act come into force? The Insurance Act 2015 comes into force on the 12th of August 2016 and changes the way the law deals with the duty of disclosure for commercial insurance contracts. The purpose of the Act is to update the current law to reflect the way in which the insurance market has evolved in modern times with the aim being to achieve a fair and balanced regime between insurers and insureds. What you need to do? Under the Act insurance contracts will still be based on good faith and you will have a duty to make a fair presentation of the risk to insurers which will include disclosure of: - Every material circumstance which as an insured you are expected to know or ought to know about the risk for which you are seeking insurance; or - Sufficient information to put a prudent insurer on notice that it needs to make further enquires to revel those material circumstances. You must ensure that any information you provide is correct to the best of your knowledge and subject to you having conducted a reasonable search for information. This could require you to obtain or verify information with a number of sources who may hold or have access to important information about your business or the insurance risk. This may include key decision makers or those with responsibility for arranging your insurance (including us as your broker) or other parties that carry out outsourced functions for your business such as (but not limited to): Senior managers and those with accountability for managing functions relevant to the risk Persons normally involved in arranging insurance for the organisation Persons covered by the insurance e.g. co insured or sub contractors Employees who may have in-depth or specialist Knowledge on processes and procedures Risk Managers Outsource contractors and service providers What happens if I make a misrepresentation? In the event that you make a misrepresentation of information which is considered to be deliberate or reckless i.e. you were aware that you were making a misrepresentation or did not care whether or not you were misrepresenting the risk, an insurer will be allowed to avoid your policy, which means that any claims you make will not be met and no refund of the insurance premium will be made. If however you make a misrepresentation of information which is not deliberate or reckless i.e. you appropriately carried out your duty to make a fair presentation but made an honest mistake or omission there are a number of remedies which may be applied by the insurer to achieve a fair outcome as follows: If the insurer can prove that it would not have written the policy at all, the insurer can avoid the policy but must return the premiums paid. If the insurer would have accepted the risk but on different terms, the contract is to be treated as if it included those terms. If the insurer would have entered into the contract but charged a higher premium, the insurer may reduce proportionately the amount to be paid on a claim. Warranties & Terms ----- have the effect of turning representations made by you into a warranty will be prohibited under the Act. An insurer will no longer be able to avoid a policy where a breach of warranty occurs; instead cover will be suspended for the period that you are in breach of the warranty. This means that where it is possible you may be able to remedy the breach of warranty and continue with the insurance policy; However Insurers will not be responsible for a loss during any period where cover was suspended for a breach of warranty. The insurer cannot avoid a policy or limit or discharge its liability for non-compliance with any terms which are not relevant to the loss or did not increase the risk of loss which has occurred. In order to ensure that you remain fully protected, you must continue to advise us of any warranty on the policy that you cannot comply with An insurer may wish to contract out of certain elements of the Act subject to your understanding and agreement and we will advise you of the implications of this should the situation arise. As your insurance broker you can rest assured that we are on hand to help you understand your obligations under the Act and to guide you through the process of gathering the information required to make a fair presentation. We will undertake to present this information to insurers on your behalf in a way which is clear and accessible. We will contact you in good time before your next renewal to formally start the process. In the meantime if you would like to discuss the insurance act or any other r elated Insurance matters please contact us. -----

Included within the renewal pack are the following documents: Renewal Schedule Renewal Statement of Fact Policy Summary Policy Wording **The duty of fair presentation (non consumer customers only)** It is your responsibility to provide a fair presentation of the insurance risk based on you conducting a reasonable search for information. This could require you to obtain information from senior managers within your organisation or other parties to which the insurance relates or who carry out outsource functions for your business. You must disclose every material circumstance which you know or ought to know or failing that disclose sufficient information to put your insurer on notice that it needs to make further enquiries.

In some cases this could result in your policy being declared void by an insurer and your premiums returned. Any deliberate or reckless breach of the duty of fair presentation could result in your policy being declared void by an insurer with no refund of premium. **The basis for our recommendation is as follows:** **How we made our selection** We are not under a contractual obligation to conduct insurance distribution exclusively with one or ----- more insurance undertakings and we do not give a personal recommendation on the basis of a fair and personal analysis. We therefore provide you with a list of insurance undertakings with which we may and do contact with regards to this type of insurance. **Angel Risk Management LTD** The Insurance Company have been recommended because of their ability to meet your Demands and Needs, their level of service, their premium cost, their expertise in this field, the length of time they have been established and their specialism in this type of insurance.

We use Gateway Capital Limited hereinafter after referred to as the Premium Finance Provider (PFP) who, subject to acceptance and criteria, will provide funding to you. We may also be able to offer finance for your insurance premium through your insurer, details of which have been included below if available. In arranging premium finance there are a number of benefits, including: - Not having to pay the full amount upfront; - The ability to support budgeting by spreading the cost; - Having a single credit agreement and direct debit for a number of policies which can reduce paperwork and thereby saving you time. Please be aware that using premium finance will be more expensive compared to paying for your policy in full at the start of your policy, as outlined in the table below: |Col1|Premium Finance|Single Payment| |---|---|---| |Total amount funded|£112.00|£112.00| |Service charge|6.5%|| |Representative APR (variable)|14.87%|| |Total charge for credit *|£7.28|| |Typical monthly payment of|£11.93|| |Total number of monthly instalments **|10|| |Final payment of|£11.91|| |Total amount payable|£119.28|£112.00| - If you choose to pay for your premium(s) by applying for premium finance and entering into a credit agreement with the above PFP, this is the how much more it will cost rather than paying your premium as a single amount at the start of your policy. ** This is the duration of your credit agreement; however, your policy is for a 12 month duration. Important information in relation to your premium finance quotation The following information should be read in conjunction with the “Terms of Payment” section of our Terms of Business Agreement (TOBA) with you. We are providing you with information about this payment option on a non-advised basis from which you will need to make your own decision as to the suitability of this facility and whether you wish to proceed. Please consider the financial commitment you are making when entering into an application for credit. Please note that your policy cover will cease if you fail to keep up payments on any instalment agreement in relation to your insurance premium. In arranging premium finance, we will use the personal data provided by you. Details on how we will use your data are detailed in our TOBA which also includes a link to our Privacy Notice, or you can request a copy by contacting us. In assessing your application your data will be shared with the PFP who may use credit scoring, credit reference agencies and automated decision-making systems to carry out anti-money laundering checks and credit assessments. This type of search does leave a footprint on your credit report but should not have a detrimental effect on your credit rating. ----- Should your application for premium finance be unsuccessful, the PFP will notify you in writing and you will need to find an alternative way to pay for your insurance premiums. Please note that by entering into a credit agreement with the PFP, you are assigning all your rights, title and interests in and to your insurance policy. This means that should you fail to keep up the monthly repayments, your PFP has the right to instruct cancellation of your insurance policy and offset any refunds due or claims payments outstanding against the balance remaining on your credit agreement. Cancellation rights*: Where this is a new agreement, you can withdraw free of charge from the credit agreement without penalty, within 14 days of signing your credit agreement. After this time, additional fees will be incurred. If you do withdraw, you will have to pay back any credit you received and find an alternative method of paying your insurance premium. *This right only applies to private individuals and sole traders as well as small partnership (consisting of two or three persons) and unincorporated bodies (such as trust, members’ clubs, voluntary organisations, charitable organisations and religious communities) where at least one member is an individual. Should you wish to pay using the PFP facility offered to you, we will instruct your PFP and unless you inform us or your PFP otherwise, your PFP will mostly communicate with you in an electronic format, using either your email address or their online portal; this will also allow you to sign your credit agreement electronically and manage your plan.

Our Service As an independent insurance intermediary, we generally act as the agent of our client, which means we would act on your behalf. We are subject to the law of agency, which imposes various duties on us. However, in certain circumstances we may act for and owe duties of care to other parties, including the insurer. We will advise you when these circumstances occur, so you will be aware of any conflicts of interest (situations which may affect our role as your agent).

Any claim or series of claims arising from one act, error, omission, incident, or original cause shall be considered to be one claim. We shall not be liable to you for any loss of profit or loss of business whether directly or indirectly occurring and which arises out of or in connection with the provision of our services. Nothing in this paragraph shall exclude or limit our liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or for loss by our fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation or breach of regulatory obligations owed to you. You are welcome to contact us to discuss increasing the limitations of our liability and or varying the exclusions set out above. ### 5. Important Information (consumers only) Under legislation, it is your duty as a consumer to take reasonable care not to make a misrepresentation to an insurer, which means you cannot provide any false information. A failure by you to comply with the insurers request to confirm or amend details previously given is capable of being a misrepresentation. It is important that you ensure all statements you make on proposal forms, claim forms and other documents are full and accurate and we recommend that you keep a copy of all correspondence in relation to the arrangement of your insurance. An insurer has the right to take corrective measures if it can deem the misrepresentation to be either deliberate, reckless, or careless. **If in doubt about any point in relation to your duty to take reasonable care and subsequent qualifying misrepresentations,** **please contact us immediately.** ### 6. The duty of fair presentation (commercial customers only) It is your responsibility to provide a fair presentation of the insurance risk based on you conducting a reasonable search for information. This could require you to obtain information from senior managers within your organisation or other parties to which the insurance relates or who carry out outsource functions for your business. You must disclose every material circumstance which you know or ought to know, or failing that, disclose sufficient information to put your insurer on notice that it needs to make further enquiries. You must ensure that any information you provide is correct to the best of your knowledge and representations that you make in expectation or belief must be made in good faith. If you fail to make a fair presentation of the risk this may result in additional terms or warranties being applied from inception of the policy or any claim payment being proportionately reduced. In some cases, this could result in your policy being declared void by an insurer and your premiums returned. Any deliberate or reckless breach of the duty of fair presentation could result in your policy being declared void by an insurer with no refund of premium. **If in doubt about any point in relation to material circumstances and reasonable search, please contact us immediately.** ### 7. Financial crime Please be aware that current UK money laundering regulations require us to obtain adequate ‘Know Your Client’ information about you. We are also required to cross check you against The Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI) HM Treasury consolidated list of Financial Sanctions Targets in the UK as part of the information gathering process. We are obliged to report to the National Crime Agency and/or Serious Fraud Office any evidence or suspicion of financial crime at the first opportunity and we are prohibited from disclosing any such report. We will not permit our employees or other persons engaged by them to be either influenced or influence others in respect of undue payments or privileges from or to insurers or clients. ### 8. Solvency of insurers We cannot guarantee the solvency of any insurer with which we place business. This means that you may still be liable for any premium due and not be able to recover the premium paid, whether in full or in part, should an insurer become unable to cover its own financial obligations. If you have any concerns regarding any insurer chosen to meet your insurance requirements, you should inform us as soon as possible. ### 9. Terms of Payment Our payment terms are as follows (unless otherwise agreed by us in writing): - New policies: immediate payment on or before the starting date of the policy. ----- If payment is not received from you in accordance with the above terms, we, or your insurer may cancel or lapse the relevant policy/policies, which could mean that part or all of a claim may not be paid. You may also be in breach of legally required insurance cover. If you choose to pay for your insurance premium using a finance provider, your details will be passed onto them. We will provide you with a breakdown of the costs of your monthly instalments and subsequently a document outlining key features of their credit agreement with you including any fees they apply and the cost of charges if you have failed to make a payment (default charges). It is important that you take time to read this document and must contact us if you do not receive this. If you have any queries or questions, either about the service provided by the finance provider or their terms and conditions you should in the first instance contact them. Where your policy is paid via the finance provider and you choose to renew your cover, we will again continue to pass your details to them. If any direct debit or other payment due in respect of any credit agreement you enter into to pay insurance premiums is not met when presented for payment or if you end the credit agreement, we will be informed of such events by the finance provider. In certain circumstances we may be contractually obliged by the finance provider to notify your insurer to cancel the policy. Where we are not contractually obliged to do so by the finance provider, if you do not make other arrangements with us to pay the insurance premiums you acknowledge and agree that we may, at any time after being informed of non-payment under the credit agreement, instruct on your behalf the relevant insurer to cancel the insurance and to collect any refund of premiums which may be made by the insurer and use this refund to offset the amount levied by the finance provider on us. If this amount is not sufficient to cover all our costs, we reserve the right to pursue any additional debt owed to us through a due legal process. You will be responsible for paying any time on risk charge and putting in place any alternative insurance and/or payment arrangements you need. Upon receiving your strict acceptance to pay for insurance premiums through the finance provider, we will instruct them to proceed with your application for credit. This process will involve the provider searching public information that a credit reference agency holds about you and any previous payment history you have with that provider. The credit reference agency will add details of your search and your application to their record about you whether or not your application is successful. Please read carefully the pre-contractual explanations and the information regarding the cost of credit (including any representative examples). Together they provide important information in relation to the credit facility available from the finance provider. Credit is available subject to status. ### 10. How we hold your money All client money is handled by us. Client money is money that we receive and hold on behalf of our clients during the course of our dealings such as premium payments, premium refunds, and claim payments. This money will be held by us either as agent of the insurer or agent of the client, determined by the agreement we have in place with each insurer. Where money is held as agent of the insurer, this means that when we have received your cleared premium, it is deemed to have been paid to the insurer. Our standard accounting practice is to take our commission upon receipt of your cleared funds prior to payment of the premium to the insurer. The FCA requires all client monies, including yours, to be held in a trust account, the purpose of which is to protect you in the event of our financial failure since, in such circumstances; our general creditors would not be able to make claims on client money as it will not form part of our assets. We hold all client monies with one or more approved banks, as defined by the FCA, in a Non-Statutory Trust bank account in accordance with the FCA client money rules. Under these arrangements, we assume responsibility for such monies and are permitted to, and may: - Use such monies received on behalf of one customer to pay another customer’s premium, before the premium is received from that other customer. - For the purpose of effecting a transaction on your behalf, pass your money to another intermediary, including those resident outside the UK who would therefore be subject to different legal and regulatory regimes. In the event of a ----- - Retain for our own use, any interest earned on client money. Unless we receive your written instruction to the contrary, we shall treat receipt of payment from you and of any claim payment and/or refund of premium which fall due to you, as being with your informed consent to the payment of those monies into the Non-Statutory Trust bank account. ### 11. Quotations Unless otherwise agreed, any quotation given will normally remain valid for a period of 30 days from the date it is provided to you. We reserve the right to withdraw or amend a quotation in certain circumstances, for example, where the insurer has altered their premium/terms for the insurance since the quotation was given, where there has been a change in the original risk information/material circumstances disclosed or if a claim/incident has occurred since the terms were offered. ### 12. Renewals You will be provided with renewal terms in good time before expiry of the policy, or notified that renewal is not being invited. Unless you advise otherwise, renewals are invited on the basis that there have been no changes in the risk or cover required, other than those specifically notified to us or your insurers (see section 5 ‘Important information’ and section 6 ‘The duty of fair presentation’). It is very important that you check the information provided at renewal to confirm it remains accurate and complete. If any of the information is incorrect or if your circumstances have changed, you should contact us immediately so we can update your details. ### 13. Mid-term transferred business When we are appointed to service insurance policies other than at their inception or renewal and which were originally arranged via another party, we shall not be liable during the current insurance period for any loss arising from any errors or omissions or gaps in your insurance cover or advice not supplied by us. Should you have any concerns in respect of a policy, which has been transferred to us, or if you require an immediate review of your insurance arrangements, you must notify us immediately. Otherwise, we shall review your insurance arrangements and advise accordingly as each policy falls due for renewal. ### 14.

Where you choose to pay your premium by instalments, we may use a scheme operated by your insurer, or we may use a single Finance Provider, Gateway Capital Ltd. We will advise you of any commission payable by the finance provider in relation to a credit agreement where knowledge of the existence or amount of commission could affect our impartiality in recommending a particular product or that may have a material impact on your transactional decision.

Where a policy is cancelled before renewal, insurers charge to cover their costs, with the balance refunded to you, subject to no claim having been made. Full details will be available in your policy. In the event of an adjustment giving rise to a return of premium the amount may be refunded or held to credit. **Your attention is specifically drawn to the following:** Where you cancel your policy after the expiry of the cooling off period or where you request a mid-term adjustment which results in a refund of premium, **_we reserve the right to charge you for our time and costs._** **_This will usually result in us_** **_reducing the amount refunded to you by the FULL amount of the commission and fees we would have received had you not_** **_cancelled. However, any charge made will not exceed the cost of the commission and fees we would have earned. For certain_** commercial insurance policies, insurers will only provide cover where the premium is due in full on inception of the policy. This means that no refund will be paid if the policy is cancelled before renewal. We will advise you if this affects you. Bank details may be retained for the purposes of refunds and claims payments that may be made by BACS (Bankers Automated Clearing System). ### 17.

Version 7 - July 2023 ----- When does the Insurance Act come into force? The Insurance Act 2015 comes into force on the 12th of August 2016 and changes the way the law deals with the duty of disclosure for commercial insurance contracts. The purpose of the Act is to update the current law to reflect the way in which the insurance market has evolved in modern times with the aim being to achieve a fair and balanced regime between insurers and insureds. What you need to do? Under the Act insurance contracts will still be based on good faith and you will have a duty to make a fair presentation of the risk to insurers which will include disclosure of: - Every material circumstance which as an insured you are expected to know or ought to know about the risk for which you are seeking insurance; or - Sufficient information to put a prudent insurer on notice that it needs to make further enquires to revel those material circumstances. You must ensure that any information you provide is correct to the best of your knowledge and subject to you having conducted a reasonable search for information. This could require you to obtain or verify information with a number of sources who may hold or have access to important information about your business or the insurance risk. This may include key decision makers or those with responsibility for arranging your insurance (including us as your broker) or other parties that carry out outsourced functions for your business such as (but not limited to): Senior managers and those with accountability for managing functions relevant to the risk Persons normally involved in arranging insurance for the organisation Persons covered by the insurance e.g. co insured or sub contractors Employees who may have in-depth or specialist Knowledge on processes and procedures Risk Managers Outsource contractors and service providers What happens if I make a misrepresentation? In the event that you make a misrepresentation of information which is considered to be deliberate or reckless i.e. you were aware that you were making a misrepresentation or did not care whether or not you were misrepresenting the risk, an insurer will be allowed to avoid your policy, which means that any claims you make will not be met and no refund of the insurance premium will be made. If however you make a misrepresentation of information which is not deliberate or reckless i.e. you appropriately carried out your duty to make a fair presentation but made an honest mistake or omission there are a number of remedies which may be applied by the insurer to achieve a fair outcome as follows: If the insurer can prove that it would not have written the policy at all, the insurer can avoid the policy but must return the premiums paid. If the insurer would have accepted the risk but on different terms, the contract is to be treated as if it included those terms. If the insurer would have entered into the contract but charged a higher premium, the insurer may reduce proportionately the amount to be paid on a claim. Warranties & Terms ----- have the effect of turning representations made by you into a warranty will be prohibited under the Act. An insurer will no longer be able to avoid a policy where a breach of warranty occurs; instead cover will be suspended for the period that you are in breach of the warranty. This means that where it is possible you may be able to remedy the breach of warranty and continue with the insurance policy; However Insurers will not be responsible for a loss during any period where cover was suspended for a breach of warranty. The insurer cannot avoid a policy or limit or discharge its liability for non-compliance with any terms which are not relevant to the loss or did not increase the risk of loss which has occurred. In order to ensure that you remain fully protected, you must continue to advise us of any warranty on the policy that you cannot comply with An insurer may wish to contract out of certain elements of the Act subject to your understanding and agreement and we will advise you of the implications of this should the situation arise. As your insurance broker you can rest assured that we are on hand to help you understand your obligations under the Act and to guide you through the process of gathering the information required to make a fair presentation. We will undertake to present this information to insurers on your behalf in a way which is clear and accessible. We will contact you in good time before your next renewal to formally start the process. In the meantime if you would like to discuss the insurance act or any other r elated Insurance matters please contact us. -----

# Guidance - Insuring-your-Shed-Guidance from UKMSA.pdf

## Information # Insuring your Shed Securing the right level of insurance is one of the most important first steps when setting up your Men’s Shed. Even if you don’t yet have a building or the building isn’t yours, you’ll need to get some level of insurance, and once you have that policy, make sure you set a reminder to renew. Some of the most common questions asked of UK Men’s Sheds Association are about insurance. What type of insurance do I need? How do I find the right insurer? What on earth is Trustee Indemnity insurance? This guide gives you a breakdown of a range of insurance products that you may need to consider for your Shed. ### What kind of insurance do we need? This depends on your Shed and the activities of your Shedders. Here is a short summary of the most common insurance products that may be relevant to your Shed. The information is not exhaustive and does not constitute legal advice, it is given as a general guide only. The guidance for each insurance product is given as a guide, however, not every insurer offers exactly the same cover for each product. You should discuss your specific needs with your insurer to ensure you obtain the right cover. #### Public Liability For damages and costs in relation to accidental injury to persons, accidental damage to property or accidental nuisance occurring in connection with the business of the insured as well as legal costs incurred. Consider if: Your group has started meeting and carrying out activities together and/or for the community. Every Shed should have this insurance product. The level of cover will depend on your activities, but at least £5,000,000 is normal. #### Property Damage Accidental damage and/or theft of assets such as buildings and contents. Volunteer possessions are sometimes covered with this product. Consider if: You have premises and/or property belonging to the Shed. This information sheet has been produced by UK Men’s Sheds Association exclusively for its members. It is for general information only and ----- ## Information # Insuring your Shed #### Product Liability Protects against claims for personal injury or property damage caused by a product your organisation designed, made, sold or supplied. It can cover legal fees and compensation costs if someone sues you. Consider if: You make and sell products to raise income, or make products for individuals, charities or community groups. #### Employer’s Liability Insurance Covers organisations if they are held legally liable for injury to an employee. It is a legal requirement to have this insurance product if you employ any staff. For organisations who mainly use volunteers, it’s still important to have employers liability insurance, as there is the same duty of care to protect volunteers as there is staff. Consider if: Your Shed employs paid workers or has a team of volunteers carrying out specific duties. #### Trustee Indemnity Insurance Broadly speaking, it protects Trustees from personal liability arising from claims of mismanagement and (in many cases) protects the organisation from the cost of legal claims against it due to mismanagement by a Trustee. The true scope of the cover depends on the provider, so it is always worth checking. This insurance does not cover claims for personal injury to the public or a volunteer as many think. Rather, it provides cover for financial losses sustained as a result of a claim of a wrongful act by a trustee. The type of things it can cover are claims of defamation or libel from another organisation, or legal investigations for non-compliance of a Trustee, carried out by the Charity Commission. This particular product causes a lot of confusion for a number of reasons and many don’t know what it actually covers, and importantly, what it won’t cover. We have therefore [developed a more in-depth guide which can be found in our Resource Library.](https://menssheds.org.uk/shed-support/resource-library/) Consider if: You believe your charity assets and/or trustees’ personal assets are at risk by a potential claim of a wrongful act of a trustee. This information sheet has been produced by UK Men’s Sheds Association exclusively for its members. It is for general information only and ----- ## Information # Insuring your Shed ### How do we find the best insurer? The best insurer is one that understands the type of activity you are doing and the level of risk associated with it. Sheds will fall foul of cheap policies for community groups if ever anything happens and the insurer wasn’t aware of the risk. UK Men’s Sheds Association have information on recommended insurance providers. They are chosen because they understand what Sheds do and apply insurance cover accordingly. To receive details on [the current recommended providers, email admin@ukmsa.org.uk.](mailto:admin@ukmsa.org.uk) ### How do we get the best insurance premium? Avoid the temptation to search around for a cheap premium at the expense of it not covering your needs, or the insurer not understanding your activities. When you speak to an insurer to arrange your premium, go into full detail about your activities and ask for an example of the policy. Look through it to make sure there aren’t any clauses that would affect your activities e.g. limiting power tool use to 20% of the time spent in the Shed. This is a real example that at least one Shed in the UK had and didn’t realise. This could cause you devastating issues if you ever came to claim and weren’t abiding by that clause. Finally, the more you prioritise good risk management and mitigation in your Shed, and the more robust your Shed’s health and safety procedures, the more likely it is that you will get a great deal on the right insurance. Never try to cut corners to save money. If you can’t afford the right insurance for your activities with all of the necessary safety measures in place, then you’ll need to suspend those particular activities until you can.

# Guidance - Trustee-Indemnity-Insurance doc by UKMSA.pdf

## Information # Trustee Indemnity Insurance We get asked about Trustee Indemnity Insurance a lot. Mostly, to put it bluntly, because Shedders want to know if there’s any point. We’ve teamed up with the pros at Ladbrook Insurance to answer all of your burning questions, and ones you didn’t know you had. We consider some of the risks that Trustees face and examine whether Trustee Indemnity Insurance is of any value to those that give their time to run Sheds. We will look at whether the legal structure of your Shed (e.g. CIO) limits your exposure and get to the root of which Sheds should consider purchasing this insurance cover. ### What is Trustee Indemnity cover? Trustee Indemnity Insurance provides some peace of mind for non-profit organisations because, to some degree, it protects members of the board if they are personally sued as a consequence of mismanagement. Board members (Trustees or committee members) might be concerned that they could be personally and financially liable from their Trusteeship, particularly in a climate where charity regulation is increasing and litigation is more common. We will look at the extent to which Sheds should be concerned and look for factors that might make some Trustees at higher risk of litigation than others. ### What is covered under a Trustee Indemnity policy? Trustee Indemnity Insurance provides a wide range of cover for both the individual liability for the members of the board and (in many cases) additional cover for the charity itself. We have provided some examples of situations where a Trustee Indemnity policy may protect a charity, at the bottom of this guide. Even if any allegation brought against the Trustees of your Shed is entirely baseless, the cover still proves valuable as it covers the cost of your legal defence. We have seen examples of litigation that soon fizzle out with a robust defence. In these, often stressful situations, it is reassuring to know that professional, experienced legal support will represent your interests. Trustee Indemnity meets costs involved not just in cases of wrongful acts, but often also of ‘investigations’ for example, by the Charity Commission and HMRC. This information sheet has been produced by UK Men’s Sheds Association exclusively for its members. It is for general information only and ----- ## Information # Trustee Indemnity Insurance ### Who is classified as a Trustee? Board or committee members do not have to be designated as such to benefit from Trustee Indemnity cover, it normally extends to any senior management of a charity too. ### How can Trustees find themselves personally liable? Many people do not realise the potential financial exposure connected to their responsibilities as a Trustee. Both the Charity Commission and UK courts can order a Trustee to make payment for financial losses suffered if the Trustee has not acted with suitable care in discharging their duties. In reality, claims are few and far between. As long as a Trustee has acted in good faith and can be shown to have acted reasonably, successful litigation is, thankfully, not that common. Indeed, for any claim to be brought, it has to be seen as clear to a reasonable person that impropriety or negligence has occurred. ### …but we have ‘limited liability’? A common misconception is that by structuring the legal framework of the Shed to limit the financial obligations of Trustees, means that there is no residual risk. Many voluntary sector organisations are making or considering the decision to become incorporated in order to protect the Trustees should the organisation become insolvent. Mistakenly, a number of Trustees feel that by incorporation, their own personal liability is entirely limited. This is not the case. Incorporation can actually impose additional duties and liability in some areas. The directors of the corporation (who will be the same as charity Trustees) will not be insulated from their corporation’s own direct responsibilities. They are still potentially held personally liable. It is key to remember that limited liability refers to a director’s liability back to the organisation. This is irrelevant if an individual is suing a director directly. This information sheet has been produced by UK Men’s Sheds Association exclusively for its members. It is for general information only and ----- ## Information # Trustee Indemnity Insurance ### Should your Shed buy Trustee Indemnity Insurance? Claims for Trustee Indemnity are infrequent, certainly less frequent than claims for property damage or against public or employer liability. Not every Shed, whether incorporated or unincorporated, should buy Trustees indemnity insurance. The argument put forward by the Charity Commission is that each organisation should attempt to limit the chances of any potential loss or wrongdoing. In theory, this would negate the need for cover, as long as your risk management is effective. In reality, while this approach will reduce the chances of needing this cover significantly, even highly organised charities with sophisticated risk mitigation might still consider a residual need for some financial protection for Trustees. In an increasingly litigious society, where Trustees of charitable organisations are not immune from claims being made against them, we recommend this is an area of cover that your Shed committee considers. We would also stress that the infrequency of claims coupled with the relative complexity of your organisation might mean that choosing not to cover personal liability will be the right call for many committees. ### What do you mean by relative complexity? If you read the claims examples provided at the end of this guide, it could be suggested that the more complex an organisations activities and the more assets it owns, the greater the need for this cover. For example, maybe your Shed owns property or plans on subletting part of the Shed; perhaps you are employing staff or embarking on a large project involving contracts, planning permission or similar. Equally if you had more complex tax arrangements or perhaps significant funding for specific projects, the risk to Trustees would increase too. As a final consideration, your group might also think about Trustee recruitment. Finding Trustees with appropriate skills and experiences can sometimes be a challenge and organising appropriate insurance protection might provide comfort for potential Trustees. This information sheet has been produced by UK Men’s Sheds Association exclusively for its members. It is for general information only and ----- ## Information # Trustee Indemnity Insurance ### How much cover should our Shed get? If you do decide to purchase cover, there is the question of how much. There is no right or wrong about how much cover to buy. Each charity should assess their risks and that exercise should give an indication of the sorts of claims that could be brought against Trustees. As an experienced charity insurance broker, Ladbrook can also provide you some statistics (on request) to indicate what other similar size organisations have covered. Of course, each organisation is different and what another charity has done is not necessarily right for your own organisation. ### Example Claims Claim for Alleged Trespass: The neighbouring landowner to the trust claims that recent constructions carried out by the trust infringed on their property. The trust claims that documents from the 18th century show that the previous owner passed the land over to them, whereas the claimant declares that the land never legally belonged to the previous owner. The claim was upheld and that the claimant is indeed the legal owner of the disputed property. The Trustees will be responsible for damages and for restoring the land to its former condition. Costs were met by their policy. Claim for Alleged Defamation: Following publication of an article, the charity Trustees were sued for defamation by another charity with similar objectives. The claimant stated that certain statements made in the article were untrue and gave a false representation of the charity. The matter was eventually settled out of court with considerable fees being paid. Claim for Alleged Breach of Authority: A claim was made against an individual Trustee by one of the charity’s employees. Before the charity ceased operating the Trustee had indicated that employees would receive an enhanced redundancy payment, which was in breach of his authority. As a result, several This information sheet has been produced by UK Men’s Sheds Association exclusively for its members. It is for general information only and ----- ## Information # Trustee Indemnity Insurance employees had made financial decisions based on that statement, and hence ran up costs to cancel these arrangements. Claim for Alleged Denial of Access: A claim was made against the Trustees as they had sub-let a section of their premises to another organisation. This had been done without consultation to the landlord and broke the conditions of the lease on the property, and subsequently the landlord ordered the eviction of the sub-tenants. The evictees brought a claim against the Trustees for denial of access. Claim for Dishonesty of a Trustee: A claim was made by a charity, which had suffered a loss in excess of £12,000. Due to poor internal controls, one of its Trustees managed to fraudulently withdraw substantial funds. Although it is an unpalatable risk to consider, unfortunately, Trustee fraud is a rare but potentially very damaging risk to a charity. Claim for Libellous Action: A claim was made against the Trustees for alleged slander. After initial discussions the allegation was retracted and an apology offered. The solicitor’s fees, which had been incurred were settled for over £1,500. This information sheet has been produced by UK Men’s Sheds Association exclusively for its members.
