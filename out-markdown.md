# Trustee Indemnity Insurance

We get asked about Trustee Indemnity Insurance a lot. Mostly, to put it bluntly, because
Shedders want to know if there’s any point. We’ve teamed up with the pros at Ladbrook
Insurance to answer all of your burning questions, and ones you didn’t know you had.
We consider some of the risks that Trustees face and examine whether Trustee
Indemnity Insurance is of any value to those that give their time to run Sheds. We will
look at whether the legal structure of your Shed (e.g. CIO) limits your exposure and get to
the root of which Sheds should consider purchasing this insurance cover.

### What is Trustee Indemnity cover?

Trustee Indemnity Insurance provides some peace of mind for non-profit organisations
because, to some degree, it protects members of the board if they are personally sued as
a consequence of mismanagement. Board members (Trustees or committee members)
might be concerned that they could be personally and financially liable from their
Trusteeship, particularly in a climate where charity regulation is increasing and litigation is
more common.

We will look at the extent to which Sheds should be concerned and look for factors that
might make some Trustees at higher risk of litigation than others.

### What is covered under a Trustee Indemnity policy?

Trustee Indemnity Insurance provides a wide range of cover for both the individual
liability for the members of the board and (in many cases) additional cover for the charity
itself. We have provided some examples of situations where a Trustee Indemnity policy
may protect a charity, at the bottom of this guide.

Even if any allegation brought against the Trustees of your Shed is entirely baseless, the
cover still proves valuable as it covers the cost of your legal defence.

We have seen examples of litigation that soon fizzle out with a robust defence. In these,
often stressful situations, it is reassuring to know that professional, experienced legal
support will represent your interests.

Trustee Indemnity meets costs involved not just in cases of wrongful acts, but often also
of ‘investigations’ for example, by the Charity Commission and HMRC.

### Who is classified as a Trustee?

Board or committee members do not have to be designated as such to benefit from
Trustee Indemnity cover, it normally extends to any senior management of a charity too.

### How can Trustees find themselves personally liable?

Many people do not realise the potential financial exposure connected to their
responsibilities as a Trustee. Both the Charity Commission and UK courts can order a
Trustee to make payment for financial losses suffered if the Trustee has not acted with
suitable care in discharging their duties.

In reality, claims are few and far between.

As long as a Trustee has acted in good faith and can be shown to have acted reasonably,
successful litigation is, thankfully, not that common. Indeed, for any claim to be brought, it
has to be seen as clear to a reasonable person that impropriety or negligence has
occurred.

### …but we have ‘limited liability’?

A common misconception is that by structuring the legal framework of the Shed to limit
the financial obligations of Trustees, means that there is no residual risk.

Many voluntary sector organisations are making or considering the decision to become
incorporated in order to protect the Trustees should the organisation become insolvent.

Mistakenly, a number of Trustees feel that by incorporation, their own personal liability is
entirely limited. This is not the case. Incorporation can actually impose additional duties
and liability in some areas. The directors of the corporation (who will be the same as
charity Trustees) will not be insulated from their corporation’s own direct responsibilities.
They are still potentially held personally liable.

It is key to remember that limited liability refers to a director’s liability back to the
organisation. This is irrelevant if an individual is suing a director directly.

### Should your Shed buy Trustee Indemnity Insurance?

Claims for Trustee Indemnity are infrequent, certainly less frequent than claims for
property damage or against public or employer liability.

Not every Shed, whether incorporated or unincorporated, should buy Trustees indemnity
insurance.

The argument put forward by the Charity Commission is that each organisation should
attempt to limit the chances of any potential loss or wrongdoing. In theory, this would
negate the need for cover, as long as your risk management is effective. In reality, while
this approach will reduce the chances of needing this cover significantly, even highly
organised charities with sophisticated risk mitigation might still consider a residual need
for some financial protection for Trustees.

In an increasingly litigious society, where Trustees of charitable organisations are not
immune from claims being made against them, we recommend this is an area of cover
that your Shed committee considers. We would also stress that the infrequency of claims
coupled with the relative complexity of your organisation might mean that choosing not
to cover personal liability will be the right call for many committees.

### What do you mean by relative complexity?

If you read the claims examples provided at the end of this guide, it could be suggested
that the more complex an organisations activities and the more assets it owns, the
greater the need for this cover.

For example, maybe your Shed owns property or plans on subletting part of the Shed;
perhaps you are employing staff or embarking on a large project involving contracts,
planning permission or similar. Equally if you had more complex tax arrangements or
perhaps significant funding for specific projects, the risk to Trustees would increase too.

As a final consideration, your group might also think about Trustee recruitment. Finding
Trustees with appropriate skills and experiences can sometimes be a challenge and
organising appropriate insurance protection might provide comfort for potential
Trustees.

### How much cover should our Shed get?

If you do decide to purchase cover, there is the question of how much. There is no right
or wrong about how much cover to buy. Each charity should assess their risks and that
exercise should give an indication of the sorts of claims that could be brought against
Trustees.

As an experienced charity insurance broker, Ladbrook can also provide you some
statistics (on request) to indicate what other similar size organisations have covered. Of
course, each organisation is different and what another charity has done is not
necessarily right for your own organisation.

### Example Claims

Claim for Alleged Trespass:

The neighbouring landowner to the trust claims that recent constructions carried out by
the trust infringed on their property. The trust claims that documents from the 18th
century show that the previous owner passed the land over to them, whereas the
claimant declares that the land never legally belonged to the previous owner. The claim
was upheld and that the claimant is indeed the legal owner of the disputed property. The
Trustees will be responsible for damages and for restoring the land to its former
condition. Costs were met by their policy.

Claim for Alleged Defamation:

Following publication of an article, the charity Trustees were sued for defamation by
another charity with similar objectives. The claimant stated that certain statements made
in the article were untrue and gave a false representation of the charity. The matter was
eventually settled out of court with considerable fees being paid.

Claim for Alleged Breach of Authority:

A claim was made against an individual Trustee by one of the charity’s employees. Before
the charity ceased operating the Trustee had indicated that employees would receive an
enhanced redundancy payment, which was in breach of his authority. As a result, several

employees had made financial decisions based on that statement, and hence ran up
costs to cancel these arrangements.

Claim for Alleged Denial of Access:

A claim was made against the Trustees as they had sub-let a section of their premises to
another organisation. This had been done without consultation to the landlord and broke
the conditions of the lease on the property, and subsequently the landlord ordered the
eviction of the sub-tenants. The evictees brought a claim against the Trustees for denial
of access.

Claim for Dishonesty of a Trustee:

A claim was made by a charity, which had suffered a loss in excess of £12,000. Due to
poor internal controls, one of its Trustees managed to fraudulently withdraw substantial
funds. Although it is an unpalatable risk to consider, unfortunately, Trustee fraud is a rare
but potentially very damaging risk to a charity.

Claim for Libellous Action:

A claim was made against the Trustees for alleged slander. After initial discussions the
allegation was retracted and an apology offered. The solicitor’s fees, which had been
incurred were settled for over £1,500.
