Pyton code to use with AI on my Laptop

the pdf2txt3.py can be used to convert a whole director full of files into a single markdown file.

the this can be fed to an AI as a single prompt with the question added at the end of the file

this has been proven with a folder containing multiple pdf files that gave a 550KB md file fed to Googlle Gemini Pro 1.5 using the systemsculpt AI plug in for Obsidian and then clicking the "Generate" hot key.
